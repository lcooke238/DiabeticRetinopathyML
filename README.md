# Diabetic Retinopayht Exploration: Repository Structure
```code```: folder that contains code
- ```exploration.ipynb```: notebook with initial data exploration, figuring out how to best isolate the features of interest from the original data
- ```preprocessing.ipynb```: runs the most successful image preprocessing functions developed in the exploration file
- ```modeling.ipynb```: first model attempt, uses a prebuilt cnn network along with some additional layers (and no transfer learning)
- ```modeling_baseline.ipynb```: base model attempt, uses a prebuilt cnn network along with some additional layers with minimal to no image preprocessing
- ```modelingv2.ipynb```: final model, uses similar prebuild cnn network to first attempt, uses transfer learning and cleaner images
